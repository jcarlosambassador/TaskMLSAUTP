                    I am currently studying Systems and Computer Engineering at the Technological University of Peru. I am in my 7th semester and I lead a university community, where I have developed team leadership skills and technical knowledge. We have organized presentations, contests, and academic workshops for students, focusing on education in emerging technologies.
